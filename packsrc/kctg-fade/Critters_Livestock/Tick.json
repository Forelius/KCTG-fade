      "value": "<p>Ticks are insects that latch onto passing animals and common folk to feed on their blood. They are found in tall grasses and wooded areas, waiting for a host to brush by. Everytime a herbalist has to handle an tick, as they are known carriers of diseases, it asks the farmers to check all livestock that they own as well.</p>",
