This belief may stem from Druidic traditions, which hold that the agate stone shares a strong connection and bond with the surrounding earth. Among the highest class of commoners, however, there exists a strict code of conduct regarding which finger and hand the agate gem should be worn on, a practice that changes depending on the day.</p>",
