      "value": "<p>The Forest is a necklace crafted from copper and set with a zoisite implement. While copper is a relatively inexpensive material, the presence of the zoisite balances the value, resulting in a piece that has a surprisingly high price. Yet, because copper is somewhat fragile, these necklaces are often found in crowded places, having slipped from their wearers' necks after the copper has corroded.</p>",
