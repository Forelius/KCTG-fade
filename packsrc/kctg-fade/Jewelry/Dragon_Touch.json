      "value": "<p>Dragon Touch ring is a scam ring piece, deliberately marketed as the missing third component to complete the prestigious set featuring 'Dragon's Eyes' earrings and the 'Dragon Heart' pendant. Primarily manufactured from Iron Pyrite and a cheap Agate, it does posses some value. However, the moment the piece of jewelry proves not to be what it was sold as, the silver-tongued scammer is nowhere to be seen.</p>",
