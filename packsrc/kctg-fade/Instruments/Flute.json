      "value": "<p>The flute is known for its adaptability, being made from a wide range of materials such as bamboo, jade, glass, blackwood, bone, and various metals. Its light, bright sound has made it a beloved instrument in many cultures, especially in tavern settings where it often forms part of a trio with the lute and harp. Beyond its popularity in taverns, the flute is also widely used in rituals, celebrations, and folk traditions, giving it a strong cultural presence in both formal and informal events across the realms.</p>",
