      "value": "<p>The tambourine is a versatile percussion instrument featuring a wooden frame with pairs of small metal jingles known as zills. It can be played in many ways such as held in the hand, mounted on a stand, shaken to produce a lively sound, or struck sharply with the hand or a stick. Musicians can also use the tambourine attached to their leg or hip for added rhythm.</p>",
