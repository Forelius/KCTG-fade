      "value": "<p>Timpani, frequently referred to as kettledrums, are percussion instruments characterized by their striking sound. Played with specialized drumsticks known as mallets, held in pairs. Musicians often have a collection of timpani mallets on hand, as each mallet produces a unique timbre and sound. The variety enhances their role in orchestral music, where they provide a one-of-a-kind rhythmic experience.</p>",
