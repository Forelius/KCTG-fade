      "value": "<p>To plant the Dark-Kron seed, a miner picks a small round hole, places the seed inside, and uses either ground bones mixed with wax as a nutrient source, or a combination of wood, charcoal, and glue to plug the hole. After three days, a soft light begins to emanate from the wall where the Daer-Kron seed was planted. Slowly, a mushroom unfurls, casting an eerie but comforting glow throughout the chamber, called Neon-Ront. For those navigating the underground depths, these fungi are not just lights but beacons, guiding them safely through dark tunnels.</p>",
