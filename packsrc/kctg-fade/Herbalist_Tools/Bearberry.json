      "value": "<p>A lot of gatherers, herbalists, and alchemists grow Bearberries around their workplaces, as it is assumed that they attract bees and hummingbirds, to help with pollination and honey, and butterflies to harvest their wings. The Bearberry fruit is used very loosely in medicine, mainly in medicinal teas. Bearberries are also used by Leatherworkers as a tanning agent to turn hides into leather.</p>",
