      "value": "<p>Belladonna Fruit is one of the most toxic fruits known throughout the realms. As such, it is only farmed and harvested by the most skilled Gatherers. Without the proper expertise and knowledge, inexperienced folks might be fooled into eating the cherry-like fruit.<br />After being processed, it is sometimes used in cosmetics as its effects are considered to have an attractive and seductive quality. When a solution is dropped in the eyes it dilates the pupils. The plant has multiple applications, however, its main usage is to create very potent poisons. It is speculated even Emperors have fallen to it. </p>",
