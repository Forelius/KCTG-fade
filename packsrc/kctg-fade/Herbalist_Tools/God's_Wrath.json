      "value": "<p>Sometimes called Brimstone, and more commonly known as Sulfur. Alchemists usually use blocks of sulfur in creating potent acids that can burn through anything. <br />It is often at the center of disputes between alchemical and religious groups, as by some religions it is believed to be sacred, given how it burns in a unique color with the flames a rich purple shade. Alchemists however advise against burning the blocks as they believe that doing so can inflict irreparable damage to one's health. <br />Herbalists use it to create multiple types of green dyes.</p>",
