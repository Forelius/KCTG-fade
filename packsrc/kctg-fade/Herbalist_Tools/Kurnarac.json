      "value": "<p>Deep within the cave, the Kurnarac seed is carefully planted. With a precise shot from the slingshot or a modified crossbow, it lands against the ceiling, sticking fast. Years pass, and once a small seed begins to grow, its upside-down tree-like form takes shape as its spiky bark gradually thickens. The cold, damp cave becomes the perfect environment for a steady, almost imperceptible growth. Over the decades, its roots stretch downward, like a stalactite forming, until the Kurnarac matures, its bark now a thick, protective shell. The need for harvesting fades, as the plant naturally preserves its Wall Meat within, offering sustenance that will last indefinitely.</p>",
