      "value": "<p>The Henbane, also known as the Witches Plant, is a highly toxic plant, similar to the nightshade, however, herbalists use it, in combination with a plethora of other plants, to create anesthetic for sale for any medical practitioners. The Henbane is also a ritualistic herb, being used by magicians and healers in ritual purifications by smoke as well as in the preparation of concoctions, love philters, and 'flying ointments'.</p>",
