      "value": "<p>The crow is a clever creature, when making it, most say it's a watcher and a guide, a creature that knows the secrets of both the field and the midden. Binding two of its feathers is said to capture a small sliver of that cunning, and for the red string tied to its base? That acts as a focus. It binds the magic, so to speak, keeps it from wandering off. This specific suppersticion is divided as for every soul who sees it as a lucky charm, there’s another who’ll spit on the ground and call it a fool’s gamble. </p><p></p>",
