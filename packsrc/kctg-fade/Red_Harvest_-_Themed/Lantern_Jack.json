      "value": "<p>Ah, the Lantern Jack. No market cart nor tavern stoop feels quite right during Red Harvest without one grinning back at you. At its simplest, it’s just a hollowed pumpkin with eyes and a mouth carved in, a candle guttering inside. Yet there’s something more to them than vegetables and wax. Stand in a village square at dusk, the chill coming down, and those rows of leering faces look near alive, like a crowd watching you from the dark.</p>",
