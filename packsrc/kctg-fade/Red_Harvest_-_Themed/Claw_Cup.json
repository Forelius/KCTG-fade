      "value": "<p>I’ve drunk from many strange vessels in my years, horns carved from aurochs, clay mugs still warm from the kiln, even a polished turtle shell on the coast, but nothing feels quite like wrapping your hand around a Claw-Cup at Red Harvest. Picture a goblet where the stem is forged iron, darkened and rough as old blood, and shaped into a talon. Its black claws grip a bowl of smoky glass as if it’s holding on for dear life. Some smiths even add scratches and nicks so it looks as though the claw fought for it.</p><p></p>",
