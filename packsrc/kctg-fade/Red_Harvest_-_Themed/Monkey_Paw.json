      "value": "<p>Monkey Paw... this paw grants wishes. Each finger stands for one, and once a wish is spent, the finger locks tight, stiff as bone. It gives you what you asked for, aye, but it takes the spirit of your words and twists it like a rope. I knew a caravan master who begged for endless gold. He got it, but it rained from the skies as molten coins, burning his camp to ash. By the time you’re on the last finger, most folk would sooner beg for death than ask another boon.</p>",
