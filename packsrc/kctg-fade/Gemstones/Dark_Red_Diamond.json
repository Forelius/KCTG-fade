      "value": "<p>The gem is cut in a round shape, and when it refracts light it looks as if a fire is embedded in it.  In the right light, these polished gems resemble droplets of blood. They usually come in dark red to brownish-red colors. They are also known as the most expensive variant of a diamond. It is speculated that when a spell is cast with its help, part of the caster's soul gets consumed along with the diamond.</p>",
