The most prized of these metals is crucible steel, which is known for its strength and durability. In times long gone it was said that crucible steel was forged in the fiery depths of the earth, tempered by the heat of a thousand suns. It was so strong that it could hold its edge even against the sharpest of blades. The finest blacksmiths would spend hours, if not days, working the crucible steel, carefully shaping it into the desired form. The result was a weapon or piece of armor that was virtually indestructible.</p><p></p>",
