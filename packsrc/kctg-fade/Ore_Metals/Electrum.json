In most cities, the balance between gold and silver is roughly 50-50 for the Electrum coin or bars manufacturing, however, in the more remote areas a higher percentage of silver is used. Due to this, most regions have stopped using Electrum coins altogether, as they match the big cities' manufacturing style.</p>\n<p> </p>",
