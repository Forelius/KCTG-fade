      "value": "<p>It is known for its shimmering, golden appearance, often confused with gold, and is highly prized by blacksmiths. They usually wait months, if not years, for only small amounts of the ore, however, when they manage to obtain it, they will always turn a profit. When worked into bars, its surface is covered in intricate, swirling patterns that seem to change and shift as the ingot is moved. When held in the hand, daliumite feels warm to the touch and seems to have a faint vibration.</p><p></p>",
