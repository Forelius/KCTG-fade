      "value": "<p>A nickel ingot is a small, perfectly formed bar of pure nickel. It is said to be incredibly dense and heavy, and can only be forged by the most skilled blacksmiths. The metal has a shiny, silver color that glimmers in the light, and is an incredibly resilient metal, able to withstand even the strongest blows. Many tales and legends surround this rare and valuable metal, with some claiming that it holds magical properties and can bestow objects with incredible strength and durability, however in most regions it’s main purpose is for the creation of multiple types of coinage.</p>",
