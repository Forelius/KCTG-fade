One such creation is an ingot that can be used to reinforce a weapon, making it so powerful that it can even break mountains when it strikes true. It is said that when Alchemical Brass is added to a regular weapon, it increases the weapon's accuracy and increases the chances of striking vital areas, making the strikes even more fatal.</p>",
