Initially, like everyone else, they did believe it to be gold, but a quick assessment by the blacksmith from the area revealed it wasn’t. Unfortunately, that blacksmith was never heard from again. Fast-forward a couple of years, The Thieves Guild manages to replace all jewelry and all coins in the region. Eventually, it reached the lordship, and he sent a battalion to the town... I'm unsure if it still exists, as neither the battalion that was sent nor a word of the Thieves’ Guild ever came from that region.\"</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Iron Pyrite also known as the Fool's Gold, has limited uses, it is mainly used as a form of ignition in firearms, creating a small spark to ignite the gunpowder. It can also be used with flint as a method of starting fires.</p>",
