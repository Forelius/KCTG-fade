      "value": "<p>\"<em>Each favor has a price</em>” stands etched on the side of the golden coin in a forgotten language. Usually traded and manufactured by nefarious groups for an underground economy. If a service is required, a coin must be paid. The services offered can range from a piece of vestment, advanced weaponry, to castle plans, to the swift disposal of bodies. All favors, all have a price.</p>",
