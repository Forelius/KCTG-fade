The leaves themselves can be made out of gold, silver, platinum, or electrum, with various levels of purity. When testing a metal object, the leaves are scratched on a touchstone along with the object in question. Based on the residue they leave behind, it is possible to quickly identify the metal's purity or determine if it is a counterfeit.</p><p></p>",
