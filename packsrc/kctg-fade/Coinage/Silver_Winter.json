After successfully completing their last year of college, attendees are given a copper coin crafted by art students, featuring intricate seasonal markings. The coin is also available in other patterns, such as Silver Solar, Snow, or Summer, each corresponding to a different season. Despite its name, the coin is made of copper and holds a value similar to that of a silver piece.</p>",
