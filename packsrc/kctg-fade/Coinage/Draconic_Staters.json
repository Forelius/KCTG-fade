      "value": "<p>These coins, historically known as the first coins ever used, have undergone little modification throughout time. They are typically crafted by the minions of dragons, and always feature a carving of a dragon's wing or head. The dragons' hoards often contain varying qualities of precious metals, resulting in the coins being minted with a lower gold price compared to others on the market. Depending on the region, they may also be referred to as \"wings\" based on their symbol.</p>",
