This gold medallion features a dark-red diamond at its center, serving as a commemoration of the event and a means of quick identification if the king ever needs to blend in with their subjects. As each medallion is unique and only a limited number exist in circulation, some have the buying power to purchase anything on an entire continent.</p>",
