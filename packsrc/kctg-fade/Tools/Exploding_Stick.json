      "value": "<p>Exploding sticks are usually named that way for drilling purposes, to create small cracks in heavy solid rock or ore so that a pickaxe or a drill can follow up. There is usually a specialized machinist who makes them using the finest gunpowder and also sets them up. They will not produce a big bang, but they will get the job done in clearing rocks.</p>",
