Examples include a License to Bear Arms, which allows individuals to carry weapons in the presence of nobility, or a Permit to Travel or Safe Conduct license, often granted to envoys tasked with delivering messages or goods. Another example is a Resource Extraction license, which grants rights to harvest timber from a designated area of a noble’s forest. Ore, meat, and other resources also fall under the same type of license, depending on the material being gathered.</p><p></p>",
