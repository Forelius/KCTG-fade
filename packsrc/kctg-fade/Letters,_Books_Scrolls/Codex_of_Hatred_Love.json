      "value": "<p>Small journal titled this way by Valentin Wolfve contains his personal musings on how both love and hatred serve distinct purposes across various fields such as art and research, while he entirely dismisses regret. Several excerpts suggest that through the eyes of a loved one, the most beautiful portraits in history were created, while through hatred, the most in-depth research was pursued solely to discredit opposing causes. As for regret, he simply notes: \"One thing you cannot change is what is already done.\"</p><p></p>",
