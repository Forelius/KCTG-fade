Many believe there is more to this book than what meets the eye, but no one has yet identified its true purpose. Holding the book gives an ominous, unsettling feeling, and staring into its pages for too long makes it seem as if the word itself begins to warp and shift. The only clue to its origin is the name of its author is a small note stating \"One.\"</p>",
