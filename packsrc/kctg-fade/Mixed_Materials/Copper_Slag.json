Most religious buildings use it on their windows for intricate multi-hued hues and glass murals, representing scenes or deities. It also has some military applications, specifically in camouflage, when made into glass tower shields. If wielded properly, the light reflection off these shields can make the wearer nearly invisible.</p>",
