They can double as candles, emitting some light, albeit limited. They can glow in multiple hues, including red, blue, cyan, green, purple, or even pink. Despite having a name associated with fantastical creatures, they do not come from any Fae-like creatures but from underground monstrosities.</p><p></p>",
