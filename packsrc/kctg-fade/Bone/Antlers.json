      "value": "<p>Antlers are usually shed and regrown each year by deers, elk, reindeer, or caribous. Due to the replacement nature of the antlers, they can be used to make tools, weapons, ornaments, or even toys. Antler hairdressers are used as a form of leadership by shamans, spiritual figures, and druidic circles. Some forest folk use them as crowns, of different sizes, for their lords, princes, kings, or depending on the case, emperors.</p><p></p>",
