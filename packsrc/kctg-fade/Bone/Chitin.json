      "value": "<p>In underground villages and cities, chitin is a valuable commodity, as it is sturdy and lightweight. This comes from specifically slain insect-like creatures that roam in the darkness. Some farms exist for chitin; however, anything extra brought in by wannabe adventurers is always welcomed, as skilled crafters can turn it into valuable tools, weapons, clothing, or even armor.</p>",
